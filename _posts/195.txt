The heart here is sad and the poems slight lines focused. Image follows image. The birds do not chirp. And the shadow people are real shadows. The houses are all empty. The widows broke. Such is the mood caste by Reverdy. His soul has no shield. Reverdy's poetry as translated by master poet t. hibbard exists in the book's title: lonely night. No better title than lonely night. No other definition other than lonely night. Taste the empty.
