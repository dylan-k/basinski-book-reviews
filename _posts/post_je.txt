Zine appears 2 or 3 times a year and the price -Hello out there!!- this is cheap! Hey, they lookin for poems and readers! Hey, if you're selling pencils on the street corner for a quarter each you only gotta sell 12 to get this N.K. premier issue! Come-on, cough it up..

Havin been to Hamtramck a few times and visited a number of bars there and the Polish club, I had to go to Don Winter's poem, Hamtramck Street Scene, as my first read in this mag and was not disappointed to find that his poem and then like the other poems in this Naked Knuckle stands in the ethical tradition of small press poetry that refuses to flee from the fall of virginity, the sexual metaphors possible by the sensitive arrangement of tomatoes and cucumbers and the sperm spited out of the mouths of whores.
