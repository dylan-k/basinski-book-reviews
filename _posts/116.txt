The true, the real poet St. Bum of Athens America Micheline barefoot and real still wanders and walks with us via his poems. If you have not approached them, do. For Micheline the ego is in the grave. And all there is IS! The clarity of not just WRITING the poem but BEING the poem - amazingly clear, the senses, the program of his writing, his only holy purpose always there as poetry.
