Hibshman edits a poetry magazine called <cite>Fearless</cite>. He's been around and you can read him in a liquor store full of poetry magazines: Midnite Toast, Sink Full of Dishes, Coke Fishing in Alpha Beat Soup, Not Dead But Dreaming and quarts more. So, I said, alright, let's go. What does this fearless lad have to offer. And I must admit, I was surprised because Hibshman can spin the line: 

> Jesus was strung up at thirty-three / I am just strung out- - -innocence being fucked in the men's room of life's last bus top- - -I feel like the first cunt ever fucked as liquid hands grip my prick in a glorious spasm draining infinity from the center of existence silver disc skim a river of sand whirling with the soft hum of the ages as I come a lifetime...

And there is this riff from his poem Sylvia Plath:

```
little
black
frightened
pigeon
splattered in
the chrome grill
```
