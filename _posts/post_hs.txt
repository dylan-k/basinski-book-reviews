 As definition of what jazz poetry is and the reading of jazz poetry and figuring it out and fingering it. Give this a listen to two too two. I'm in. Me too. Me three. And of course jazz jazz jazz is not far form Kerouac's work. Then if you wish it! Here a highly listenable, greatly listenable, manifestation of the best of what jazz reading can be. Here I offer you a small table of Dave Church reading, in a smoke filled room in the mind and the heart with a hole in it out of which comes this delightful, sweet strange sound of Dave Church reading jazz poetry. He reads the works of Jack Micheline, A. D. Winans, Kent Taylor, Ann Menebroker, Bob Kaufman, Kaye McDonough, George Tsongas, Charles Plymell, Dave Church, Art Beck, Linda Lerner, Brenda Frazer, Tony Moffeit and etc. etc. there are more and there are multiple works by many of those listed above poets. So here you have poets going into your ear. Church's voice fits this style and he has the tone to pull his voice out and play deep into the night. Obviously, also, this an anthology and a focused one, one with a program also and as far as jazz, take this CD before picking up any book or poems what claim they are the jazz representative poems of. NO. The jazz poem is to be heard not read at all. And here hear Church dong it all with justice.
