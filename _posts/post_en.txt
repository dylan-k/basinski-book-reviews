The poet Holly Day speaks spiritual, otherworldly unity, peace in a land of human garbage and garbage generated by humanity. It is hard to find nirvana in the intellectual and literal rubble of the world. Still, the quest via the art of heart poem yields the realization of a small amount of contentment in reality. So one is left with only a glimpse, an islet, because one must recognize the brutally and limitation of humans, and flesh and mind before entering love that exists even in darkness where it might be limited but still may, must be.
