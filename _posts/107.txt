Simple enough to begin a small collection of poems by calling the small collection of poems, POEMS. So then what occurs is this small collection gets under the skin like some wild virus or burrowing bug and the poetry like alcohol intoxicates, and this poetic intoxication will not leave and you are left with Gurney's poetry, endless and forever, all day it keeps coming back in mind until after screeching it begins to bleed.
