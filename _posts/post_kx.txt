Casus Belli, Palestine, Texas. 2003. order from Slack Buddha Press, 50 Garrison Avenue, Somerville, MA 02144. $10.00.  
The three heretics are William R. Howe, cris cheek and Keith Tuma. I wonder if it is against the poetic law to say such? Ah, so what. The text involves a ride from New Orleans or Ohio to somewhere in west Texas and the conversations of cheek and Howe were recorded and sent to Tuma who wizardriticlypoetic transformed the various wormwordsound utters and ejackulations into a form of text. Not since Triptrap with Kerouac and Welsh has such exciting road text been generated. A collage with images and of sound images and sarcasticism asceticism and world place from three outrageous points of view ' heretics indeed! Worbderfoul, fool and cripaslicious salad of American writing ' authorless, collage, combine, a form of this century.
