December 2003. 12 Gauge Press, 142 Avenida Perlayo, Unit C., San Clemente, CA. 92672. Write for price and complete information/catalog of extensive underground and small press poetry. Get in the loop!

Winans is by far one of our best all around, succinct and absolutely faith filled blue-collar loyal, lit of society proponent, truth intoxicated, small press entrepreneur and kingundergroundpoet of the last 4 decades. I Saw the Best Minds of My Generation by A. D. Winans is a one poem book and a storm of small press axe and sword and bone slicing hacksaw poetry it are! Obviously it engages Allen Ginsberg and the cover is set up like a City Lights book. And what's it about&hellip; let me quote a bit from Winans: '&hellip;starving hysterical naked under fashion designer clothes&hellip;' See. Now I like Alien Ginsberg's poems a lot and the world of poem would be a worst pile of shit if not for him. Nevertheless, Beat and all is too human and therefore corrupt. BNAG and BANG! It is all too true and A. D. Winans:: open the sky for the stars.
