A solid poet who can skip-rope words, chew gum language, write a complicated poem and knit it with IT! into a visual image so the works act on heart, mind, ear and eye all at one time kinda poem stew and still billboard be presence, present the deep thinking poet with form at command his, he commander of form, and the singing of the emotional via the center of his self can be heard as there is Mars in the sky, there is moon in the sky, there, there is Perlman's constellations of words becoming poems becoming poetry forming the patterns of living.
