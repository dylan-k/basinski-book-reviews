This is a tiny book composed of only two poems - you can hide it in your pocket, you can hide it in your shoe, and the poems are written by one of the more interesting pals of Francois Villion hanging around the pool hall. I do believe that these two poems are a two edged knife stuck in the belly of a priest. Wisniewski can run the table with smoke in his left eye and his bladder full of Coka Cola. Get as much of this guy as you can. Don't look in Borders. Order Direct &hellip; better use your P.O. box.
