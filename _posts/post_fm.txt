 A pleasant surprise to find these poems in this book in the mail. And when I read the poem Snail, in which the poet's father cooks a snail to brew a snail broth, I knew, yes, the broth of memory brewed with poetry was in the cup of my hand. The steam of these, the perfume, the poet is in the world.
