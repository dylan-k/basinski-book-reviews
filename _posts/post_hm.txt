Gerald Locklin at his best spinning poems after viewing paintings and pondering seriously, ruefully the comings and goings in and of real life. Easy flowing, cadence rich beneath the surface of the lines. Rye. Pondering. A poet who trusts in the poem and a poet who trusts his vision. Now, think, instead of Sister Wendy walking around an art gallery interpreting paintings, what if Gerald Locklin could do the show! Heck, I am writing to PBS today! Locklin on PBS would solve that network's economic problems! If you don't know what I mean - buy this book! It will fit in your back pant's pocket.
