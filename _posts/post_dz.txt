Hamlin. Free Thought Publications and 12 Gauge Publications PO Box 6011, San Clemente, CA. 92674. Haiku is the most populous and popular form of poetry in the USA. Check out the Spamku website! The form of poetry in the grip of Bradley Mason Hamlin becomes a fat robin, filled with wiggling worms, with a pig's heart in the jaws of lion. Holy Shit! .
