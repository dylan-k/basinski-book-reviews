The poet Jefferson Hanson's imagination organizes about specific philosophical/emotional instances that he manifests into words that create a realm between the real world and the mind's abstraction of it. He finds his way, and if a reader is willing to read, really read, slow and deep and ponder and allow his poetry to work its way magic than this rare gift of Hansen's poetry will pervade and become also your present. These are two short books of recent selections by a poet's poet and the poet's daughter does the cover. Sample lines: Your idea of me/ gathers more of me/ than I ever could.
