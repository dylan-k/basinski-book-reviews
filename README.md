# Michael Basinski's Book Reviews

[Michael Basinski](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/michael-basinski) contributed these reviews of poetry publications to a webzine called <cite>[The Hold](https://web.archive.org/web/20090301055656/http://the-hold.com:80/index1.html)</cite>, from 2000-2005. He was the Associate Curator of [The Poetry/Rare Books Collection SUNY at Buffalo](https://library.buffalo.edu/pl/about/).

The reviews describe the works of poets and publishers at a time right before the web became ubiquitous, so they are a useful archive as well as an enjoyable read.
