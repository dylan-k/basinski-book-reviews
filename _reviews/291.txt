Perhaps this is Kevin Thurston's first book. As such, it points to a career that will challenge the shape of writing. It smashes words at the level of THE word. It invades and mutates writing. This is a slim, beautifully printed, fun and intellectually impressive book that depicts the invasion of the vowel O into our words, for example: O onto oor words, foo example: O onto oor woods, foo oxomplo: O OOOctra. Therefore, the writing is fun, humorous and playful as well as, so to speak, deadly serious about altering language. Be thirsty for Thurston. Watch for his name up in the Dolights.
