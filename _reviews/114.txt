Wine writing entering as a dance and a celebration of imagining a festival of flowers and spring, of burgeoning flesh/fresh blossoms new again mythology - in the traditions of the high romance of Shelley and Byron, ric royer, a Hermes of the 21th century, weaves wreaths of a re-imagination of the becoming of spring with his Dionysian poetic, and myth skin, veiling and teasing throughout - most ethereal moon worshiping, and where words are born Worbs of wine drink this drunk where poetry begins hovering over and around the silky bulbs pushing blossoms up through the pages of myth.
