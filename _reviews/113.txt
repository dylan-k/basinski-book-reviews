An exceptional work of modern poem music - using the page as score and space and time - variants and variations on ideas and images becoming the UN and UR real and the real and that real that is not real, and other reels that include real heat, and steam heaters, dreams, toilets and affections, all of which inhabit this entity of art wor(l)ds that falls and floats and is in between, and not, the realm that governs thoughts and the music of furnaces, toilets and dreams (all instruments) played by those others that inhabit this space as poetry with and others like poets.
