&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Buffalo running at the speed of darkness," softly Beat speaks poetic poetry
Jim Cohn this line among the among of highways of soft B-Bopping  -not
clobbering you but the erotic messaging of Jim Cohn's spoken voice-  Jazz
riff lines on this CD called: Antenna. The more meditative nicotine smoke
filled quiet backroom, hash smoke filled voice of Jim Cohn melodically
seduces with his liquidity spoken poems filling all spaces between the
spaces of the empty and lonely American heart-soul and mind of a person (you
and me listening this) in the room, a room of another world where time is
left outside with your worn shoes or split soled sneakers.  As if in the
room, this poet sitting across from you in truth emptying his soul, slowly,
seeping, rain, soaking, penetrating the dry desert forest of everyday and
washing it away. Check website for price and other stuff.

IL. 61920-1865. No Price Given. <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a book of haiku by American haiku-er genius Lee Gurga, master in
controller of form haiku. Now, you should know if you have not, good reader,
figured it out, that haiku is the ruling form of American poetry. Gurga is
among those spreading the seeds. I have already written more words than in
this entire little good book by Gurga. Let's say, in this book is one of the
best all time haiku or any ku or any poem ever written (buy the book -
published by John Martone - send him some stamps and money). Here's the
poem, a poem that can only be in the haiku form for maximum impact:<p>
what to do?<br>
a penny face up<br>
in the urinal<p> &nbsp;<p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locklin here brings to the counter a good slice of American apple or cherry
pie, maybe Boston or banana cream, with cold vanilla ice-cream - over the
top and melting or on the side, depends how you like it. His populace wit
and wisdom here shows how poetry is all of the common American life that
each of us lead with our own unique logic and magic and how this strange
life we lead is full of twists and veils and in his poems he loves to pull
off the pretence of the everyday, blast away the one way of narrow thinking,
the mask of poetry being hard to get at and handle and sticks his finger
into the socket to point out ridiculous of our beliefs.  I laughed out loud
in the midst of his poem, "I Like Cat that Catch Things, when he pointed out
that some birds are not endangered and therefore can be food for cats and
their ultimate trophy like the old in the old man in the sea's great fish.
And of course the title poem of the book is a wonderful homage to American
speech via iceberg lettuce. Oh so American and lunch counter Locklin, a
consummate poet. Here an easy introduction to one of our, our of us like cab
drivers, butchers, heath worker, averagers, that is one of if not our Best
Poets!<p>&nbsp;<p>

<a name="4"></a>&#149; <b><u>- Rock/The Boat -Book One-</u></b><br> by Kenneth Warren. Oasis Press, C/o Stephen Ellis,
23 Mitton Street, Portland, ME 04102. Get information from Ellis on prices
and the tons of other stuff he has published. ((Come on - being a poet
doesn't mean writing poems - it is writing letters to find out about stuff
like Ellis has got, got it? Get it!)<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these poems has the title of a well-known pop song, Duke of Earl,
Jailhouse Rock, Long Tall Sally, Nowhere Man, Sad Eye Lady of the Lowlands,
etc.  This merging of poetry and pop alone makes this an amazing text. And
then it is a beautiful retelling of each song (in a form) and the incidents
of each are a weaving of that song in your head with the imagination of the
poet. The music, the pop tune plays on creating a multi-level poem because
the song has triggered a memory that plays along with the poet's poem.
Pulling together the lyrics, the times, the lines memory and music, a
stunningly unique piece of poetry, readable, understandable, fresh, new, and
strumingly deep appears as a tune drifting in the memory and in the poetry
of this moment.  So simple a thing Warren knows we all measure out lives via
pop-music. With this simple device he is able to bridge the troubled waters
between the lives of the poetic of the all day long and the art of
imaginative, exploratory poetry of intense and personal and intellectual
self.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we serious about this? Four bucks is Christmas tree needles under the
carpet, dead ants, a pound mushy molding smushrooms, a gallon a gopher gas
in Afghanistan….! Joyce and Wendell Metzger are out there doing it and you
can do it also with a fist of four dollars and a few bird feathers in your
gapping poetic maw. So get together the four bucks. I know you got more than
four between the couch cushions or under the front seat in the car. Take
some soda cans back or all those beer cans on back porch. What's wrong with
you reader? Take ZZZ ZYNE No. XXVIII (this means 28 in Roman). In the middle
is a best poem by Antler called: Job Replacement for Loggers of Old Growth.
This poem itself is worth a few crappy dollars. Look the government is
making all the money look like play money - so you can buy more over-priced
CDs which you never listen too, or dig up your front lawn and plant more
marigolds. Therefore the logic is poetry - but only if you want it like the
poems in this ZZZ ZYNE:  d.a. levy and Lyn Lifshin, John Bennet and Catfish,
Kit, Kevin, Kell. A conglomerate of assorted passion semi-truck on the
thruway explosive poems by the escaping prisoners of the ordinary birdbaths
of your Uncle Dork's dilapidated, decapitated condo.

Serving Suggestion is a brand new poetry zine now open for business. At a
dollar a sample issue it is ON SALE and good for you to get a heaping
helping of poetry from the visual poem to the regular pump poetry gas. Yes,
a three square meal deal with Serving - something you should do. Probably
also send some poems along with the $1.00. But do tip the cook and waitress
and bus boy and dishwasher.  See work by Eric Rosolowski (and check out more
at: epc.buffalo.edu/gallery), read poems by Karen Kuehmeier - no doubt one
of the wonderful and I mean Wonder filled and exciting wild poem poets now
about and active writing, and then there is a spectacular drawing by an
internationally recognized master of the great complexities of James Joyce
(just back from a lecture tour which found him in London, Paris and
Jerusalem) - yes - non other than that Joyce master: Sam Slote. Well - I
mean you see Serving Sugg. is hardly a zine hidden in the woods - but it
will be there too.  So do it! - I know - let me repeat - send a buck. Send
some poems.<p>
