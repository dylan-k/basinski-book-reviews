Mark Weber's project recording, CD, studio with musician project becomes more interseting with each CD issued by Zerx. He is the poet using the CD as a unit for his collage composition. This one meshes Todd Moore's voice reading a poem and Ray Zepeda's voice reading a poem (a real poem, a great poem about automobile rims) and Mark Weber's beautiful sanding voice and a 6th and 7th grade orchestra playing a piece called Rainy March 1999. And some ol' time, sounds to me - I ain't no music critic - some old time black and white dance music on the side of the highway played by Okie pickers at a dance on Friday in the 1940s. This is all the people making their music in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am hearing a world of people. And this includes new music also performed in art galleries. It is all a music of the other and outer world. Weber knows also that poetry is music. I mean, and here it is on a CD. Music belongs to all different kinda folk. These things are like gloves in January in Detroit.
