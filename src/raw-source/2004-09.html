Hear young man poems soaked with love, aching love, love still bound with lush lust Uroboros in a continuum of sheets, morning separations, mouths opening, opening curtains, separating curtains and dresses falling in a heap of petals on the floor. Ah the endless pyramid of the laundry of loving made by the slaves of pungent human juices, meaning poets. Here stepping forward into the moist spotlight is Lindsay Wilson of Moscow, Idaho, who loves the women of Moscow, Idaho and who when not in embrace embraces the words to convey his sad separation passion crawling poetry tongue again up her leg of poem. Tongue! Why tongue you read and say! Well, read the first stanza of his: Late Winter Snow Storm, 2002:<br>
<br>
<i>the man by the window<br>
wipes the perspiration off with a dollar,<br>
and thinks of devil’s trumpets<br>
-purple in summer’s giving.<br>
the girl at the coffee counter,<br>
sick of steam,<br>
is getting off work<br>
with her flat hair,<br>
and talking about vegas<br>
with a swimming tongue.</i> <br><br>

So, want love poems on the pancake griddle of the far west Idaho! Oh, Wilson is there with the syrup up! <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, I have heard the name of Kell Robertson and maybe read a poem here and there. Maybe I have seen him in a picture in North Beach cowboy hat with A. D. Winans. Maybe not. Maybe it was his magazine, was it Desperado? And some say he is a cowboy poet. I don’t know from cowboys but poets I have some sense of. So I began to read this collection: The Leveling Wind, and I said, well yeah, this is about the west and places where they have cowboys and such and saloons but I said out loud to meself, “Self, this is all about poetry.”  And then I got to the poem Kansas Goddess and the Goddess has a yellow Buick convertible and there were billboards advertising cheapness. And you know who she is but who is, is also that other that is the poem and poetry and as Kell Robertson writes in his poem – a poem about the insect song of the heart and soul of a writer, he writes in his poem: Song, “all of the noises heard in the dark/ aren’t imaginary.”

<a name="3"></a><u><b>Gypsy. AKA Loose Leaf Gypsy. Spring 2004</b></u> - Vergin Press<br>
Vergin Press. PO Box 370322, El Paso, Texas 79937. <a href="http://www.verginpress.com" target="NEW WINDOW">www.verginpress.com</a> -  All ruled by Editor: Belinda Subraman. <br><br>
It has been 10 years since Gypsy rolled across these fingers and welcome now to have in hand this issue: Loose Leaf Gypsy! Gypsy is back and back and back. And back with old friends in magazine: Gerald Locklin, Mark Weber, Bart Solarczyk and batches of new poets and artists fresh from Gypsy to me (and you) – Donna J. Snyder, Joseph Somoza and a bunch more. This is Loose Leaf Gypsy because it comes in a pocket folder and in the pockets are broadsides and art. All cool. Bold and vibrant and small press concerned and champion this resurrection of Gypsy has rolled with the time but remained loyal to the root of poetry as it surged in the early 1980s when an entire generation of underground and other world/class level of poets first reached for the gold bottle of beer and seized that day with relish and passion and mustard. Ah Belinda many many will welcome your open bar of poetry!  Ah! Down in the West Texas Town of El Paso I spied a magazine dancing in air!  This star in the midnight of poetry is a teat to those poetry sailors searching for an OZ! Ah. A spirting lighthouse! Or as Justin Barrett writes in his poem Early Morning Bike Ride:<br>
<i>lamppost<br>
lamppost<br>
lamppost</i><br>
And when you write to Gypsy ask about the two new books just recently published: Last Chap by Jonathan Penton and Tango by Arden Tic and Nicholas Sands. Worth it.

<a name="4"></a><u><b>La Perruque Editions</b></u> - Slack Buddha Press.<br>
50 Garrison Avenue, Somerville, MA 02144. $5.00 each or subscribe 6 chapbooks for $20.00<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slack Buddha Press is a new press. And Daniel Bouchard’s book is the first book from this new press. And Slack Buddha is publishing the work of contemporary practitioners of writing, what includes: poetry, prose performance texts and verbo-visual work. Slack Buddha is, as fact, William R. Howe and Lisa A. Phillips. Each book is $5.00 and you can subscribe: 6 chapbooks is $20.00 and 10 is $32.00. Why not? And for sure, for sure, for sure as shit you will get in each installment a book of words used as art! Not academic fart.  Bouchard’s is the first, but here on the pile rests also Alan Halsey’s In Addition and Stephen T. Vessels’s Zip Code Poems. Each of these three is distinctly different, unique but each of these poets has a focused purpose that is really, when boiled down and rooted and fluffed and painted… each has to do with literary consistency, vision and language manipulation and each book is an exploration in literary art…so that’s The Slack Buddha project: real art by serious artists from many walks of poetry.  Halsey’s contribution to The Slack Buddha are poems titled by master poets, e.g., Samuel Butler, George Herbert, etc. and, using old form, old words are variously playful and satirical poking at these masters and having fun with poetry! Damn the seriousness! And amazing this book increases the possible by returning to the past for material. Armed with a spiked rubber hose of pen and a wide laughing smile Halsey punishes the dull. The Vessels’s book is composed of short poems defined by the first one in the collection, which acts as model for those that follow and which reads:<br>
<br>
<i>if delivery by hand becomes<br>
obsolete<br>
may<br>
this <br>
form become a testament</i><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;93117 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mailed to H. & S.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April 2000<br>
<br>
The post office becomes a revolutionary hideout! The act of writing poems, we all know is a revolutionary act. And mailing is now also the activity of the revolution only. I hear what Vessel has to say – I use the post office even if most of the employees are strange and don’t wash much. Maybe one of them is Charles Bukowski the Second or Thomas Pynchon the Three.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Kept Birds by Geraldine Monk is a book of a series of little machines of music, key wound music boxwoooords of birds, i.e., small poems with plenty of erotic vowel music listing birds harvested form/from one of those gigantic field guides and proves to me everywhere is birds and little sounds becoming poetry of nature.  Keith Tuma’s Topical Ointment puns around with sarcastic and cutting pleasure of rhythm and rhyme and infling with a wide net capturing the best of sound again and agains as this mighty poem maker he writes, <br>
<i>Better take enlightenment and squeeze it –<br>
Osama rhymes with “Yo Mama.” </i> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the review here was supposed to be about Sound Swarms & Other Poems by Daniel Bouchard and in that context: With his ear Bouchard reinvents a poetry that focuses on the natural world and her events like birds. A delight of terrific word bird music and Bouchard gets as real close to the naturalness of language fun and it becomes second nature. So – what nature is it? Nature as in the Nature of poetry or the Nature of outside the bar? What it art in facet is a measure of both that makes this wow unique vow.  This is one to have cause Bouchard will be around longer than time.

<a name="#7"></a><u><b>Black Spring. Winter 2004</b></u> - by Steve Tills.<br>
Single Copy - $7.00. Steve Tills, 98 West Main Street, Shortville, NY 14548<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting supermarket is Black Spring (from Henry Miller’s?) with a wide variety of tastes that are all cultured and focused. Hence, Black Spring is a hand of cards with poems different but the same in the pursuit of poetic contemporary experimentation, progression out from Olson and as Jim McCrary writes in his 103 section of Hotter Than And Now (let me quote it in its entirety) “Whoa!”   And then there is Catherine Daly. Let’s quote a line from her: In EBCDIC & Hex, “84 89 a2 97 93 81 a8 a2.”  I put the period in. Ah, that’s nice and and that’s only one line! So there is this real measure by Tills, whose works are within also, of him as editor renewing poets whom he has admired in other manifestations and reading and finding the freshest of poetry from about the country. Why not name them all, as if this were spermaceti or the supermarket sale paper and this store is called Black Spring. Disz week you got: Brent Bechtel, Catherine Daly, Kari Edwards, Stephen Ellis, Jim McCrary, Chris Murray, Layne Russell and Steve Tills. And Tills we meet again – enjoy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haiku has plenty of history – Japan – the Beats and 17 syllables and not and the discussion goes on and on and haiku me imagines has really become the adopted poem of American poets. Is 21st like sonnet used to be for the old goats, so to speak now – our form as American poets - Haiku (which is not to rob haiku from Japanese or purists – Haiku can handle it all and the space is vast and lots of room for arguments and frogs to plop in empty foods and sounds of one foot in the refrigerator counting angel wing toenails milk). McNiece has won this and that (check the website) and written this and that. And am happy to read his work and get to know him and I think as I eat mashed potatoes that he is really: a) poet and b) writer c) serious of American wish he show up in any town to be people’s poet d) smart and not hustler ego poet but e) poet again I write – praise the McNiece for this book of haiku that he plants in Cleveland! Yes this is where it belongs as is his self planets, plants and planted pants! Whitman of poetry person listening to poetry of Cleveland and allows unafraid the art to flow in from all the around world into his imagination and he makes these molecules of poetry with bonds so tight as to reveal that poetry is the our glue shoe to our places in the all so big and sky universe earth one eye ball looking into the soul McNiece:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three heretics are William R. Howe, cris cheek and Keith Tuma. I wonder if it is against the poetic law to say such? Ah, so what. The text involves a ride from New Orleans or Ohio to somewhere in west Texas and the conversations of cheek and Howe were recorded and sent to Tuma who wizardriticlypoetic transformed the various wormwordsound utters and ejackulations into a form of text. Not since Triptrap with Kerouac and Welsh has such exciting road text been generated. A collage with images  and of sound images and sarcasticism  asceticism and world place from three outrageous points of view – heretics indeed! Worbderfoul, fool and cripaslicious salad of American writing – authorless, collage, combine, a form of this century.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastic to find a constellation of fresh voices obtuse to the mundane vapid fish heads that float with mirrors of each other in the slug of poetry in Americow or sheep. A releaf for the rain forest of poetry. The book is composed by the four poets Christina Carter, Byron Coley, Matthew Wascovish and Valerie Beth Webber. They each have some solo works – like this chunk of sample by Valerie Beth Webber:<br>
<br>
<i>sometimes I want to ask you<br>
just what the fuck you think you’re going<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my bed<br>
with your mouth suction-cupped around my cunt</i><br>
<br>
and then the other half of book is poetry composed by the four:<br>
<br>
<i>let me press my tongue wide enough<br>
for empty rails<br>
against the sewer grate<br>
fuzzy lingulate bandit</i><br>
<br>
What da! Dazzling freshness as if the poems just spirited form the oven imagination of a constellation of other voices cutting into the void that has become small press and middle of the road duck and chicken fat poetry and boiling it and burning it and leaving it with crushed snail shells, orgasm sand and clam sput as a mark for this writing is new words and another surge of volcanic splendiddddd that announces that poetry from the other has vibrancies and fresh as a summer of razors. Contact each poet – you editurs and magazine folks and publish them on and upward so this new mountains of poetry will replace Hawaii as the destination of all imagination.
