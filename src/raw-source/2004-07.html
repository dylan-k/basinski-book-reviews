Winans is by far one of our best all around, succinct and absolutely faith filled blue-collar loyal, lit of society proponent, truth intoxicated, small press entrepreneur and kingundergroundpoet of the last 4 decades. I Saw the Best Minds of My Generation by A. D. Winans is a one poem book and a storm of small press axe and sword and bone slicing hacksaw poetry it are! Obviously it engages Allen Ginsberg and the cover is set up like a City Lights book. And what’s it about… let me quote a bit from Winans: “…starving hysterical naked under fashion designer clothes…” See. Now I like Alien Ginsberg’s poems a lot and the world of poem would be a worst pile of shit if not for him. Nevertheless, Beat and all is too human and therefore corrupt. BNAG and BANG! It is all too true and A. D. Winans:: open the sky for the stars.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan Sicoli has tapped his soul and out pours: The small press poem is a finger stained with oil or yellow with nicotine, cut at work or working on the house, the mundane of America celebrated, banal birthday candles, beer cans, a phone call, a hubcap along I-90, I-95, dreamy Route 66, a cup of vapid coffee, a Krispy cream, eggs with two pork sausages, Janet Jackson, Afghanistan, and Coors, what some refer to as camel piss. The small press poem is the corona around the sun. Sicoli has all this and a shot glass more or some shotgun shells more too. Here is his latest, The Allegories, which is a reflective collection all ways in mind and imagination full of lost and sad loves that pierce love and life like the boil it is. Imagination is the only glue that keeps the poetic heart one beating thing of art.  My head is a sandwich he writes in one poem! He is not without humor. Still this is a pondering, a sometimes melancholy set of poetry. The Allegories, fit for alcohol remorse and hangover (from living) Sundays and no, not the poem of what’s happening out on the street so much as what happens in the heart of a street poet after being at work out there in the wet, cold rain terrible world word of Monday morning back stabbing. Oh the bitter life, life sweetness, the joy of wishes and wanting weep to express celebrate breathe one last time… O poem! And laugh kinda. Have to – to keep in it on living.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“curator television for the memory loser” … a line that sticks in mind from Matthew Wascovich The Closeouts. Each line in a Wascovich poem is a distinct unit and often a definition of instances or instant poetic information. And this vital bullet or knife or poetry laid by lines, above and below one another, captures instances. Pops! Seconds when the poetic mind flips open for an instant instant half or tenth of a second and Polaroids all that is there. It all floods in as if the poem were a bathtub.  This then becomes the poem, a poem of poetry beyond the words themselves. This is penetrating work. Fresh stuff, peculiar stuff without leaving behind any of the pointed daily of it all. Savor this section of his poem Knife On The Desk (from Blinking Envelope):<br>
<br>
<i>run from things like an addict<br>
he is buried in water in india<br>
but his sounds are in this room<br>
he’s got tanks in his ear <br>
and your voice in his head</i><br>
<br>
Each line is linked but also stands as an entity itself. Can’t beat this new form of meat loaf brain poem that pour forth from fully utilized, vitalized, poeticized perception. Matthew Wascovich’s imagination sees with the poem!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Composed between 1974 and 1976 – or so dates indicate – it is remarkable how consistently useful and poignant and provocative the poetry of this voluminous, major poetic event becomes as a reader engages and gorges within its poetry. And then, to return to its girth again and again listening and responding to its beckoning call. This form of opus event in the life of a poet is a measure of a poet’s submission to the vastness of art and Thomas Lowe Taylor has here produced a poem that can only be an homage to the endlessly occurring pleasure of ever evolving form. It is in fact a document of a literary life as the poem progresses from page to page across the years of composition. A widely sprawling book of poetry, rather than book of poems, pondering form and measured by poetic music and space, the work has a unique rhythm that will intoxicate and hypnotize any reader. Of course, in essence and in the end, it is a celebration of poet and poetry and, therefore, a form of wedding. Thomas Lowe Taylor tosses one hellovaparty and all the muses arrived in risqué gowns! My copy of the Cantos is 802 pages long and there are at least 875 numbered poems in The Homags of Eagle. Hence, Thomas Lowe Taylor thrashes Pound! But like Pound’s big poem work, and Olson’s, it is work one returns to, again and again, filling up each time and knowing that there is endless more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jon Edgar and Gypsy Lou Webb image cut by Marc Snyder on cover them two from The Outsider! AH! Delight to pay homage to those that have made small press a place with a history and a tradition! So – good poets! Don’t let the academic monsters tell you that small press is not rooted in a form of poetic thought that extends back to the 1950s. Why? Because the line is there! BOS is Bottle of Smoke – I just figured that out and this BOTTLE is an all broadside magazine which I didn’t have to figure out cause when I opened it all the broadsides fell out! Started off with A. D. Winans “66” which has to do with his age and his, “hose still hard/but no one to man it.” Justin Barrett’s beer poem what is called by Justin Barrett, Six-Pack. And I think of Gerald Locklin’s beer poem, which isn’t in this magazine, but in this magazine is Locklin’s Whistler: Mrs. Meux – which has that wonderful Locklinesque twist of common sense - …He does this so well that it has got to be called the Locklin Twist! And Locklin’s publisher is Jeffrey Weinberg and Jeffrey Weinberg has in here a poem also – it about attending a poetry reading with Ralph Waldo Emerson  - Longfellow was the poet reading in the dream of Weinberg poem! What a party!  I can’t mention everybody in the (this) Bottle but the editing and gathering of these poems in this format makes it/them readable and fun and allows you take one poem out and tack to the wall, magnet it to the frig, set up in from the wine bottle and enjoy enjoy twice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to love poetry that is really poetry and that is so off the wall as to be ultimately form breaking and vibrant. Lastname writes without the limits of genre and without the arrogance of career! Forget about poetry with Lastname poetry has now been reborn as the property poetry of the working middle and people reading class! Finally a poetry that people don’t have to puke over! His poetry brain must be soaked alcohol Hula-hoop made from fermenting Lenny Bruce with Homer Melville and Norbert Mailer. This book of poems is as fresh as a new born litter of warthogs. Like Lastname’s Poem With Too Many Syllables to be a Haiku:<br>
<i><br>
I look in the mirror<br>
And I’m happy to see me<br>
Regardless of whether there’s a pickle in my pocket</i> <br>
<br>
Uproariously insane! Riotous and ball busting humor out of left field. A truck of pig bladder pouring beer pee into the pyramids.  Truly a Gregory Corso for the 21st century.

<a name="#7"></a><u><b>Palimpsests for Beckett & Walls for Finnegans</b></u> - by Carlos M. Luis.<br>2004. 50 pages. For information and price: Anabasis Press, Oysterville, Washington 98641-0216 or contact the author (for submissions to your press) at: Carlos Luis, 10099 NW 4 Lane, Miami, Florida, 33172<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlos Luis is a contemporary poet who works with the visual in his poems. This book contains two serial visual poems: Palimpsests for Beckett and the second: Walls for Finnegans. As serial works they should be engaged as those serial poems of Duncan or Olson or works that bridge one another but that do not necessarily narratively follow. Luis’s poems inform in a serial fashion that stands against conventional poetry for in life, so to speak, the random and chance change shifting of things is the pattern that commands life and that in fact nature follows.  Palimpsests for Beckett is, as one might suspect, layered language. In this imaginative vision of Beckett’s imagination Luis’s poetry is both expansive and minimal and there is the restlessness of form in the panels of poetry that is expressionistic without being explosive or rude. Walls for Finnegans is a large work of some 36 pages. And it is an intersection/interaction between the real and imagained. Day and Night. Meaning and unmeaning. It is a collage of facets that repeats its technique so the reader is constantly teased by meaning only to have meaning submerge again into the total poetic text. The imagination is left without convenient anchors and is aloud to roam like the splashes of ink that bind the work into a poem and the teasing surface meanings, chunks of collaged text and pictures, force the reader to pursue wonderment

<a name="#8"></a><b><u>Full TV Poems</u></b> - by Luc Fierens.<br>2004. Luc Fierens (Mail-Artist-Visual Poet-Postfluxpost) Galgenberg 18, B-1982 Weerde – Belgium. WRITE to HIM. <a href="http://www.vansebroeck.be">http://www.vansebroeck.be</a><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These works are the result of an evolution that has combined various genre, mail art and collage and poetry and vis-poetry, to produce a fresh fashion of literary art, which can be called: combine. It is a number of poems, in this context, that are readable and soundable and visually stimulating and expressionistic and drawn and glued and clipped. Fierens’s work is the fruit haiku of a lifetime of study and practice in the fugitive forms of art and lit. I am happy to seehear him in this book of poems in such grand and mature form dealing within these works into the erotic and socially dangerous police state mind. How a poem is political – here it is. Luc Fierens is a poet exhibited and committed but without any surrendering at all and he holds exploratory and experimental art to be first and foremost.
