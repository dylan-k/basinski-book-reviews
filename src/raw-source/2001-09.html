<a name="1"></a>Haight Ashbury Literary Journal,</b> - Volume 19, Number 1. Twentieth issue.</a><br>

I bought my issue, this issue, Volume 19, Number 1, from a guy with a gray
beard on a corner.  I don't know - Clayton and Haight? Cole and Haight? Maybe I am making this up? The guy's name - I think it was Bob and maybe his last name started with the letter P. I should have written it down. I did not. And then he was amazed that I knew who Jack Micheline and Bob Kaufman were. Do not everybody? He wanted to sell me the Kaufman issue of Haight Ashbury Literary Journal. I just saw it in a rare bookstore for $20.00. A smart poetry seller, I thought. I hope the editors know that they
got a good huckster out on the street. And union printers print the Haight Ashbury Literary Journal! These are two good things. Union and street huckster. However, the best is the poetry in the Haight Ashbury Literary Journal. It is mostly all poetry with some prose and a few drawings and a few ads - but mostly poetry. It is void of that muck produced by reviewers (like this writer) that schmooses and butt kisses and says little and only gloms on to a network or writer who might write, might return a flavor
favor and writers who call this criticism and blurbism and mumblism and hippoism and toiletism and the like. Muck. Forgive me. Thank you. But the poems, the poems. Of course the contest winner for Spring 2000 - a poem called: A Notion of Herself was a powerful one by Donald Brennan. The poem, about - so to speak - the feminine all soul and earth burgeoning. Well, I can't mention everyone but Alice Rogoff's poem Curfew stuck in mind because
it made me again realize that art does have a purpose in all the ugliness of the outside, general world. And that art is an act of breaking a social curfew. And also I was nailed by Teddy Weiler's poem: When the Fog is Gone from San Francisco, which is a poem reminding again how humanity and Bush are screwing up the air and environment and water - while he sits on his ranch. Let me ask you - good reader - do you have a ranch?  Ah - poems can be political and mean things and have purpose. Well, I am getting a bit
long winded here. Let me write about page 11. A solid page, a choice page, a cut of real red meat or if vegetarian: a carrot. Bull's-eye is A. D. Winans and up in the corner his poem: Poem for Neeli. As I understand writing, getting clear of the stuff of world to get clear to the self is a major philosophical job to get accomplished before the writing can be art and it seems A. D. Winans has it. Sure he has been around, but rightfully, there are many around a long time who miss the nail and hit the thumb or
dick in the zipper or get their tits caught in the ringer. Glad to read there are poets like Winans free of those painful poetics. And so is, on that page, John Cordova's long poem called: Ally, and Daniel O'Connell's short poem: Addiction. Both poems new species, mysterious and blazing pyramids from the African soul carried by Hippo-humans to the sea for homage to poetry.  And then Julia Vinograd's poem: The Jack Micheline Memorial.  She has this poetry, this talking poetry that I thought died with Bukowski - but here it is sweet and clear a thorn and a bee and a flower and a broken bottle of beer candid and saying what she says after
being alive with more than five senses. Jesus, I write too much. It was a good issue all away far around. Well, Haight Ashbury Literary Journal has been a lit. journal for twenty issues. Here's to twenty more. Cheers and send them money.<p>&nbsp;<p>

<a name="2"></a>Remembering Bukowski .</a></b> - by A. D, Winans (with illustrations by Raindog).<br>
48.pp. $5.00 <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Raindog/LRB.html">Lummox Press</a>. P.O. Box 5301, San Pedro, CA. 96733-5301.<p>

 I read within this little red book, which can fit in the back pocket of your pants easy enough for reading on the bus, in church, while not watching TV or screwing around with porn on the internet or emailing somebody about insurance or India or ordering a gazabutgoo bush to block your Nazi Republican neighbor's view... I read that A. D. Winans published in more than 500 magazines and that he edited for years Second Coming Magazine. I knew that. But I didn't know about the 500 publications and - how lame can I be? - I did not read, that I remembered, any of those more
than 500 publications (I assume many poems). So I had a treat. So I had an intoxication. So I hear da voice as fresh as wet kittens and frank as jumping on a rusty nail. His poems about the Buk were crocodiles and I was an overweight drunk in the Nile. Now this poet is of the gut-philosophical beer can couch, bacon, working class shoes and a suit that is too small with an outdated tie that you only wear to weddings and the too frequent funerals of friends. Let me escape my own powerful pleasurable first
impressions. Winans of short lined poems pours smooth. He remembers the great Buk as a man as much as a genius poet. Therefore, he is always fair, fart and candid and therefore finger on the trigger real. Apollo the sun. Moth for the moon. His poems are cans of tuna, starkissed. This is no easy thing to talk write without being behind the mask of the some far-stretched notion of what a poet is. Well - I am gunna tell you what a poet is: A. D. Winans.<p>

<a name="3"></a>The Eyes of a Vertical Cut </b></a> - by Ronald Wardall.</a><br>32 pp. <a href="http://www.slipstreampress.org/">Slipstream</a>, PO Box 2071 Niagara Falls, NY 14301. $7.00<p>

Ronald Wardall has a way of seeing a man pickled in a six-foot glass jar. And a way of writing about his grandmother Mary's meeting death. And seeing things, like Hemingway's suicide. And in his poem called: Patsy Cline, "I had he taste on my lips, like rust." I too had the taste of rust and winter and the smell of, "Egyptian perfume meant for the underarms of the dead." His poems strike deep - an injection with a thin needle, almost invisible,
bubbling with imagination into the a real vein. Afterwards, you thirst. Throbbing, striking with a little sweet red blood, striking what Wardall finds and defines in the real of our everydays. What he sees is really what I really think is there, dense, thickly complex with flowers and thorns, moments of clarity enhanced with art.<p>&nbsp;<p>

Before you get to page 87 you read through poetry by Gerald Locklin, Dancing Bear, Valentina Gnup, Lyn Lifshin, Robert Penick(City Edition Breaks Down - a poem about greed, November and pitiful humanity in the face of tortured nature) and Rocking Chair Frank. Maybe you stop off at Ken Feltges's poem: Happy Hour. You should. But then on page 87 begins a short story by E. R. Baxter III. The story is called: Jack Gets a Thesaurus. A treasure. It is a story, a short story that plays with the form of the short story. At each step in the narrative the narrator reminds the humble reader that the story is a fiction or a fiction being told by a writer, which is the art of the story. So the writing of the story becomes as much of the story as the story itself, which itself is a very important story about love, death, sons and fathers, coming of age, growing old and the form of our emotions in art and presenting of such in art. Still in the midst of the literary acrobatics there is a tremendous and deep earthiness
or centered facet of the story. It takes place in Niagara Falls. The characters are as real as really created characters might be and their language complete with there own manufactured words are believable. Well-balanced and mature, Baxter's prose finds the seam between the real and the making of art. He sits on this fence with one eye in each realm, reworking each separate reality into one finely woven masterpiece. And Baxter is working way hard to save Niagara Falls. All poets, you must save The Falls: www.niagaraheritage.org<p>

<a name="5"></a>That Look. </b></a> -  Words and vocals by Eve Packer and alto saxophone and music composed by Noah Howard.</a><br> 
Boxholder Records. PO Box 779 Woodstock, Vt. 05091
<a href="mailto:boxholder@aol.com">boxholder@aol.com</a><p>Eve Packer's all a poet, poetic most poetry words full of luscious phrases of speech with different inflections like imagine, "SAS sandals, comfy as peanut butter bunny slippers," and "a raincloud of gummie bears." Her work cellars and coffee and smoky of hip jazz populates this most wonderful CD of 17 works with her own vocals of her own delightful smooth poems and poemetic voice evening stars light and headlights of cars maneuvering the
city at night. And then … well - it is a duet - takes two to tango - and Noah Howard makes the pair. His alto sax and music meshes and mates with Eve Packer's voice and words to produce an urban fantasia and define what balance a duo can have - like Anubis holding the scales. Together: Ying/Yang. Inseparable. Parts of the heart merge for beating. The heart quickens beat when you get That Look, love lust - you know. You know: Red Dress my favorite cut because of improvisations and springs of speech and it is all about That Look as a truck driver sees Eve in Red Dress and
crashes into a wall.</font><p>
