As all Kirpan books, this one is first very beautiful and first it is a tribute to one of Cleveland's legendary literary heroes, Jim Lowell, and first it is a tribute to The Asphodel bookshop, and then, first of all, I hadn't realized how wonderful a poet Jim Lowell himself is - he is first rate - and first also included praise from Tom Kryss and Kent Taylor - poets who started their literary journeys, with Lowell, in the Cleveland of
d. a. levy time and first Horvath is original printer publisher of Cleveland underground books and mags. He is editor artist. His unit of composition is the magazine/book. It is most marvelous to see and hold such work by such accomplished talent in hand. But back in the old days, from Buffalo I looked out upon the same polluted lake - my friends and I called it The Dead Sea. Poor Erie. Well, the lake has gotten better and it is fine to know that there is celebration for poetry of poetry and poets in the fine spring air. Celebrate now yea of Cleveland and poetry. And although I never met Jim Lowell, Happy Birthday!

<a name="2"></a><b><u>15 Image Poems</u></b></a> -  by Norman J. Olson.<br> Beaver Lake Press, 946 N. McKnight Rd. Maplewood, MN, 55119-3635. Price: you gotta write and ask.<p>
Recently, I meeted and talkted with Norman J. Olson but I guess you who
read this will have to wait till he comes to your space to do just that.
You should invite him. Anyway, Norman writes with sharp insight into the
work, the poem world of Lyn Lifshin and you should read his reviews of her
books on the Lifshin website or is it web site - two words? But I am just
cranking up this AM here and want to get on to his poems: poems that I will
return to again and again: They are filed with the names of animals and the
animal world is alive here in this poetry. Perhaps it is a primal instinct
of the untamed, well, yes it is, that allows Norman J. to record succinctly
what is about him. Yes they are observations but enhanced via the talents
of a form of animal observation - clearer, more focused, sharper than the
dull wits of humanity. Here are some lines form Norman's "On Sunlight,":
The black and bottomless/ sky wears a blue mask/ and thermonuclear/
eyeballs gleam/ like suns. And then in this poem by Olson called,  "If I
were to Paint the Madonna," these lines: When icicles drip/ form the fat
man's lip/ and dinosaur bones laugh in the air like donuts,/ then violin
music that slips though/ a hole in the ceiling seems less out of place
than/ the mace/ on the security guard's Sam Browne. Hear the music? I hear
it. So, yeah, well you might find Norman Olson at Ryan's Bar because two
poems name the place. Or you might recognize now Norman's name because his
art, his drawings are here and there in magazines, zines and about the web.
But mostly, I think you should write Norman. Say, Hello, Norman, I am
interested in your poems and I wanna see them all. Norman will say, I
think, OK. So write and send a buck or two.

of Beat poet, San Francisco poet, street poet, political activist poet and
icon Bob Kaufman, Bob Kaufman author of "Abomunist Manifesto," "Ancient
Rain Poems," "Cranial Guitar," "Golden Sardine" and "Solitudes Crowded with

A small collection of new poems in a small chapbook that could fit in your
shirt pocket except that it is bound with sandpaper so you can read while
sanding the callous off your left foot or while sanding your finger tips
before you begin your nightly safe cracking. But let us venture into this
fine, fine collection of new poems by Gerald Locklin, Emperor of the
subconnonical of American poetry.  These poems are short poems, quick
poems, poems that explore and celebrate the humor, surprise and irony of
life and language, when obvious life becomes language and lit and poetry.
They are poems of our lives, things that happen that are transformed into
poetry, thoughts that you think but pass. Locklin writes them down for
poetry springs from living in the poems of Gerald Locklin and his quick wit
is a pleasure for all. Now, after I leave a book like this, all things
become poetry. And to heck and hell with all the gymnastics and olimpdicks
of overly worked wrought poetry, poetry where the metal fags-out from over
manipulating masturbation.  Yes, all things are the poem. This, friends and
readers, makes them art, a radical and powerful form of intrepid art that
breaks open the oak doors of high culture cathedral and brings the worship
of the gods back to drinking buckets of freshly brewed beer. For instance,
let me quote in its entirety, Locklin's poem: "Was Charles Bukowski A
Greater Writer than William Shakespeare?"  No.

<a name="5"></a><b><u>Poesy:</u></a></b> - A Publication for Poetry and the Arts.</a><br>Issue 16. Spring 2002. C/o Brian Morrisey, 106 Campbell Street No. 5, Santa Cruz, CA. 95060. <br>Issues are $1.00 for postage.<p>
Printed on newsprint, distributed for nearly nothin, Poesy is passion for
poetry - Brain Morrisey's passion and Doug Holder's passion. Passion. Even
in these dark days of oil drilling and war there are those for whom the
poem becomes the all. Here it is folks. In this most wonderful issue is a
most interesting interview with R. D. (Raindog) Armstrong editor and
publisher of Lummox and poems by Edward Obuszewski, Mark Wisniewski and
Radomir Luza Jr.  Wisniewski's poem sticks in mind. It relates the abouts
first love of wild, that is grown up, woman, real woman. And also there are
poems by David, Kelley, Alan, Kurt and Ryan. And work by Gerald Zipper. And
work by Arthur Knight and Alan Catlin and A. D. Winans. And there are
reviews. Well - you get the drift. The magazine is about poetry and these
editors work to get the good poem in print. Do not have to be the poem of
the worshiped. But the good made sandwich - good with lots of ham and
mustard and a banana and horseradish and zebra puke, refrigerators, sorrow
and sunshine. And see Holder's article: "Bold Enough to Never Give Up."
Seems like a good enough definition  of this magazine. I give it five out
five yeses: yes yes yes yes yes.

This splendid issue features Mike Kriesel: with his poems like: "Heaven's

Hartenbach - his work most interesting always endowed and rich and frothy
with Catholic imagery and he also deeply tangled and twisting with and

<a name="7"></a><b><u>Channeling Humbert Humbert</u></a></b> - by Aaron Bradford.</a><br>Bender Books, Long Beach Downtown Station, PO Box 21261, Long Beach Station, Ca. 90801.
$5.00<p>
Jeff Epley is the editor and maker of Bender books and he art changing the
notion of the chapbook by making it now, not a pathologically hastily
constructed transition work to a larger collection, but an event, a form of
Great Gatsby party by the pool and an adventure in astronomy that records
the place of stars in the sky. Ands he makes only important books. Aaron
Bradford's book is one of them. Humbert Humbert by the way, for those of
you who have not re-read Nabokov's "Lolita" of late, is the main, male
character of the novel. Bradford remains true to the lust, love and
passions that this book might conjure but that seems only a postion from
which to launch because this book of poems is a senusal love letter from
men to women. I would give it (in) as cupid's arrow. Each poem is an erotic
kiss. The reinvention, reengagement of love and lust, in poetry is an
ancient endeavor and often times the paths are dull and most poets just
roll over and turnout the light. Bradford does not. He gets up and writes
poetry and I am glad he did. Good to know that his muse is Cupid, cupid
with blue balls and a few drinks, with his tongue, his heart.

This is a greatly focused collection of poems by poet Gerald Locklin and
certainly reveals complete a phase that the poet has entered. The poems are
reflective poems and philosophical contemplation poems and comment upon
human conduct poems, which exhibit the frailty and stupidity of the human
race and undermines the arrogance with which and in which we, so many of
us, all of us, conduct our puny lives. These works are not so much about
this and that or that time past or a memory but are immediately of the
present, poet present in the world, interacting with the world and
imagination, the imagination of it in words. Locklin really is in it as a
poet in the world. He steps in it. He ain't JUST watchin it. And these are
the golden fruits of walking in the Garden of Eden poetry and there happens
to be some animal shit. Watch out God!, Gods! And Goddesses!  Toad is in
paradise! The poems are a form of art word pure in the sense that they are
involved in/with word fun -  the ironic and the humor or ironic humor of
fun with words, which is now essential Locklin and is now his program in
poetry. The poems are a splendid and solid form of observation, reminds my
of Resnikoff - the poem reality that waiting for the elevator takes
forever.  And also of Fluxus and performance poetry, for example my
favorite poem in the collection, and one destined for the selected poems,
the magnificent poem:  "Where's Wally?" Allow me to quote it completely:
fuck Wally.

Haiku is the most populous and popular form of poetry in the USA. Check out

becomes a fat robin, filled with wiggling worms, with a pig's heart in the

This is not for those of you who masturbate at the drive-in or in the
drive-thru at McDonalds (well maybe). But better this is for those of you,
dear readers, who ride elephants off the Alps and descend upon the washed
and combed puny pony poodles of Rome (and places like the University of
Iowa), with pen sword in grip cutting the falling bodies of professors and
poets in sandals with white socks and drinking their blood mixed with
Queen-O. Loki and Odin wrestle the frost giants to get their hands on each
new issue of The Whirligig. This issue is the wine of Homer and Whirligig
is the cup that Christ will not allow to empty. After reading this issue of
Whirligig, I imagined that I was a US cavalry private, captured by Apaches
in a black and white movie, circa 1958, and I was tied down, shirtless,
over an ant hill, with my bindings of buckskin soaked in water, so that
when the broiling hot Arizona sun rose and climbed towards noon, my wrists
would open and spill my blood on the sand and provide a banquet for mice
and fire ants and vultures. Damn - Frank Marcopolos is Lord of Editors!
This issue is a festival and Poe would weep big tears of lusty fog just to
hold for a second the power of Whiligig and start with Ann Sterzinger's
prose work: "A Beautiful Son."
