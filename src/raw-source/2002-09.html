A tremendously fun book, with amazement on each page and humor also -

shifting pops the mind into yes, I see.  Chance generated from 4x4

these neat 14 line poems this poetry engages the tech.stuff of this mod.
world. Most contemporary high-tech poetry runs like this: poet thinks of an
idea and puts it on the web. Web proves the poet's idea not poetry (mainly
because the poet doesn't do any poetry anyway). But Hear: Here then in
ISOTOPES, Zimmerman, smart read deep, Gnostic poet imagines and writes,
engages the writing with some form of tech, here anagram generator, and
then reengages with imagination, his poet imagination, engages the raw
material and produces poetry. This is the way to deal with poetry with tech.
Ah. Zimmerman shows us the path through all the websites, emails, hypertext
dull forest of unpoetic silliness. He makes poetry. Look for the light. He

A nice chunk of collection by one our youngest and best. Shane Jones is one
of those rare poets for whom poetry is living. Frightening how close to the
fallen and sparking electric lines of heart and soul he comes. Melding in
fact. This book divided into three sections: Moister or less clothes, the
sweetness of love - smell and puddles of robins, bunny slippers; and the
crumbling toast of a burned out love smothered with rancid butter and hard
cream cheese… and horrible fact that memory does something to old romances
- makes you remember only the crickets, the ice cream, the wonder of
Niagara Falls etc. See what fools we all are. But we see through these
windows and Shane Jones keeps them open.

Hugh Fox master being and form of Lord in Small Press circles has with vast
energy and deep knowledge knows all of the small press world more than any
other and better than all those teachers of poetry out there in the fancy
soft cheese world of poetry. But poetry knows Fox. Fox is the fashion in
witch one protects oneself from the unchained dog, the way of doing of
other peaks of authors. He knows so perfectly knows and that poetic is here
displayed in this poem of Boston that brings together in one spot all that
living and poetry are when merged. All places one place all information one
information a mesh and a meld and merging and coming together and implosion
of diversity - words-art-gods  - and the like all like into one spots. Here
Fox is the intersection of all roads, which then makes him poet and allows
him, with clarity and ease, to make the poem, weaves it out of all the
waves coming ashore.<p>

Visual works. I am sure that these are examples of imaginative deep
writing, they being other symbols and lines merged into new forms or
developing alphabets - now we have a name for these works - Asemic writing.
That is the word: Hear it: ASEMIC. But for me the delight of these books,
written in Asemic, is the reading of this work - because the new writing in
these new worlds/works with other alphabets demands a form of reading that
translates into sound each glyph or string, poem- therefore new sounds must
be made and the expansive experience is then IT. Wonderful to touch down on
this terrific planet of other writing. These authors stretch it and brake
it and broke it and IS now someplace else … in the other… place of
creativity. Obviously the air is there breathable, beautiful. Let's go.
Paint your wagon, and come along.<p>

Henry is the author of: The Farting Dog, which can be found at the sight
above-mentioned. Here is a stiff whiff: This is/ the true story/ of a
German/ ballet dancer/ who couldn't/ make it/ in Hollywood/ and ended up/
in a German/ movie/ featuring her/ with a farting dog. And just want to let
you know that the moral rights of the author have been asserted. The rights
of Harry Wilkens to be identified as the author have been asserted in
accordance with sections 77 and 78 of the Copyright etc. The poem is about
Sylvia Seidel, a young Munich ballet dancer, and now actress, explains
Wilkens, who as poet king of mid-Europe and Alps, goes on to say, who got
the LUCK to be introduced into Hollywood by Kirk Douglas. Henry Wilkens is
a gas! Check out the site… but I mean… go there for Hank's poems! I mean he
is in the great line of Henrys: Henry the 8th, Henry Miller, Henry
Hemingway, Henry Bukowski, Rames the Henry.<p>

<a name="6"></a><b><u>Postcard Poems</u></b> - by Del Ray Cross & Cassie Lewis.<br>2002. Cassie Lewis, 1401 Red Hawk Circle #G302, Fremont, California, 94538. To order copies,<br> write to <a href="mailto:casslewis@graffiti.net?subject=basinskibookreveiws_thehold">casslewis@graffiti.net</a><br><br>
"I've got a revolver/ I revolve," this line in the poem Foglifting by Del
Ray Cross that sticks in mind and in my admiration chamber. And this poem
is part of the sequence by Del Ray Cross in this postcard collection. And
the other half of this correspondence is Cassie Lewis, "freedom comes
disguised/ as a book of poems." Two burgeoning poets finding their rhythm
as writers by the simple demand of riting writing each day to each other a
poem, a poem on postcard. This fruit then of this conversation and merging
is this book of poems, which reads, classically like an open book to the
room in the recesses of the creative mind. The space created by mail, ol'
time, like post office, allows the poems the distance of authenticity and
this then genuine poetry conveys its intense, hence real, so to speak,
emotion, to the humble reader. Each poem arrives in the mailbox of the
imagination, and then opened and then read in the heart.

The other day I was taking a walk, as has become my custom. You see, I must
take weight off, eat vegetables (raw without butter and salt!), and all
that bow-wow, woof woof. And I came upon some shards of plastic drinking
cup, which I dreamed once held some very cheap draft street picnic beer.
And as I looked closer, the shards seemed to become stick figures of people
and then ghosts and then they became full fleshed figures, as mush as
flattened plastic drinking cups can become full fleshed figures and art.
Art was what I was left with as I wandered away. (Lucky I did cause as I
gazed upon the flattened shards of plastic I heard a couple guys sitting on
a porch say, "Look at that crazy asshole." So as I walked I understood how
finding stuff like Yoko Ono did and does, how everything is art as you come
upon it and find it and it is the spinning off of whatever one encounters
that makes everything art and that we live totally in art if we are artists
or get into the rare rhythm of the artist's mind, where, yeah, everything
is art. And if you are a poet then everything becomes poetry. Wow I said as
I read this new book by Gerald Locklin. Wow this in fact is the highest and
bestest poetry there could ever be. Here I have encountered an artist of
the greatest caliber. Locklin is artist as everywhere.  Damn! I was so
happy that the door to my enlightenment came from a plastic beer cup,
squished. I think Ger would like that notion. And to those guys on the
porch,  "kiss my ripe rotten butt."<p>
