<a name="1"></a><b>Bad Poetry Digest</b> - 
. Volume 1, No. 10. Edited by Daniel A. Russell. 2010 Oak
Motte Lane, Austin, Texas 78744-5058. Send Money and BAD POETRY is yours to
keep.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad Poetry Digest is the tops and ranks four stars **** or Hell - five stars
***** - No! : 10 stars**********.  By far BPD is the best new poetry
magazine to cross these magic-marker-stained fingers in a good long while. In this only four-page zine, photocopied, editor Daniel A. Russell creates a poetic world that smashes the state of both poetry in hard copy and also on the web. Bad poetry is a cut-up - pure collage magazine. Anything that finds its way to his mailbox is the stuff of the poem. It is poetry? It is poetry. Everything is poetry and here it is proved. And then, we are all used to editors as compilers. Yes, and a good job they do. Russell, however, is
intimately involved with creativity. He is editor as creator. He doesn't center a poem on the page; he makes the page as his poem using other poems as bits of his own poem. The page is his unit of composition. And narrative flow? His pages have multiple entry points. There is no just start at the top and end at the bottom. Truly, here, one enters the imagination and is then surrounded by it. Images are also brought into the page. You have to read/say Hitler when you see Hitler's image or any of the other images. Therefore, a form of symbolic language, the symbolic language of pop culture is utilized in Russell's work. It seems I could go on and on here. You should see it yourself. Send something. Send some money. Get a copy. Change your own poetry.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987, near Exit 13 in and around Elizabeth, New Jersey, Exit 13 Magazine occurred in the mind of Tom Plante, and it drives on now into the waning of year 2000. Portals into poetry in this issue include a poem by (King) Charles Bukowski, which editor Plante received more than 10 years ago and now for the first time the poem finds print and light. And a wonderful Bukowski poem it is. In it the poet is attempting to locate blackheads
instead of writing poetry or is poetry blackheads? Well, poetry is to
ponder. And also enclosed here poems by (a wonderful one as always from King of Progressives) Richard Kostelanetz; (a bouquet - my favorite is Jazz Dog) by Charles Plymell (picture of poet page 33 on) - he writes, "dolphins may turn out to be/ like Buddhists who took to the sea."; and Scot Roskos - the BIG HAMMER god! - of happy guts of poetry and hearts pounding! and Ed Smith; and Gerald Stern - now - see - A national Book Award Winner does not have to be arrogant - his work right here in the poetry magazine with Bukowski and M. E. Grow.  Let's not forget the women: Anne Britting Oleson; Kathe Palka
Nicole Melanson etc. Let's not forget: Noteworthy Books, Back Issues
Available and Poets World! Let's not forget editor Tom's work on page 24: Care to Dance?  Check it out: take exist 13 home for the holly days, holidays or Helladaze.<p>

<a name="3"></a><b>Black Bear Review</b> - Fall/Winter 2000, Issue 31: A Literary Magazine for the
Concerned Poet & Artist. $6.00 an issue $12.00 a subscription. Ave Jeanne Editor/Publisher, 1916 Lincoln Street, Croydon, PA 19021-8026.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To begin, the title of this long time living magazine is one of my
favorites: Black Bear. There is a Black Bear restaurant in Lake Placid, New York. No relation.  One gets comfortable in Black Bear. Carefully edited, selected one feels - meaning, it seems, the editorial staff took the time to read manuscripts and select poems by merit and not by author or theme. Gosh, then this makes this magazine a magazine of the trenches, a workhorse for those poets on the way. This issue, issue 31(wow!) is yellow - could be one of the yellow bricks on the yellow brick road towards the POET OZ of canonization!  Only the editors know how much work it takes to do such a thing. Ahhh, Ave and company are the Gods. Now in the midst of the white wine and soft cheese world of poetry where your dad and mom own a building
in Paris, apartment in Hong Kong and homes in New York City and Florida, where poets have trusts, new cars and houses, their underpants dry cleaned, spread liver on crackers, have someone else buy their heroin, pose for each other and write posing poems about posing things totally disconnected and unconcerned about right wrong, justice, reality, life in the US of A, the world and anything beyond their arrogant, poodle, chauffeured vain poetry world - ahh there is our our OUR Black Bear.  Thank you Black Bear. Don't let this one become an endangered species.<p>&nbsp;<p>

<a name="4"></a><b>Lost and Found Times No. 45</b> - November 2000. Subscription is $25.00 for 5 issues. Editor: John M. Bennett. Luna Bisonte Prods, 137 Leland Avenue, Columbus, Ohio, 43214.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of the poem, as we find it being suffocated by SUVs, resides an outpost, a tower, a Tower of Bababells overlooking a vast, endless sheet of paper covered in the most horrible shit in the shape of poetry. But in this holy place, high above the Great Offal Sea, is pureNESS of The Lost and
Found Times. Oh HOLY! HOLEY! The First Hoel! A bulletin, a bullet in the head of the carp sucking at the nipples of the egomirror career carcass rotting in the hot flood of maggot crap. Lost and Found Times always has its fingers crushed in the door of glossy air brushed with ego and talk about wine pornographic poetry room. One must write that John M. Bennett is a true trooper of the imagination. Never satisfied with the boredom poem or poetry life in the upper class suburbs, Bennett and The Lost and Found Times provide a Circus Maximus where the dull and dim are put to the s(word). If in you all find you all self at odds with the Kenyon Review and such ilk, but still lust ink, seek The Lost and Found Times, for in its humble pages resides one of the few paths through the Red Sea.<p>
