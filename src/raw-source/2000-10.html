&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thunder Sandwich No. 11 is a gigantic site packed with probably three or
four thick magazines (the antique ancient paper kind) of stuff like well:
poems from Ron Androla, Cheryl Townsend and our Hold It Hostess: cait
collins. And others: Bart Solarczyk and Mark Hartenbach.  There's a
Charles Plymell column also and lots of photographs of poets readings and sitting around poeting. And reviews of important small press books. Links, reviews articles, emails, and etc. the future of outsider poetry. A good picnic
with uncles and aunts who let you drink and sneak off to the bushes.
High-octane alcohol. The most revolutionary, of course, cause represents a social state of poetry void from the tedious wealthy rich-kid South of France words.Not that suburban cell phone in the SUV on the way to the craft store. No idle time. Nor no idle threat.</font><p>

<a name="2"></a><b>&#149; <u>Peshekee River Poetry.</u></b><br>Spring 2000. Peshekee River, Tom Blessing, Editor.
 PO Box 689 Eastpointe, MI 48021. A couple bucks.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the correct size for an in hand paper magazine so when you reading eating toast in the AM or on the bus it is all easy to handle. In this one: 26 poems total by Ron Androla (which are always fantastic - cause Androla - here remembering the part sometime - truly is a poet in the real way poets are artist using words - he is the great unrecognized one), Jim Chandler (always placing the cold hard sand meat in the thunder sandwich), Donna Hill (I quote, "instead, barren and numb this night/ I walk patiently over their/ tiny jagged edges slicing/ my tender unkissed bare feet"), Lyn Lifshin (Her highness of highness underground - passion on a bone china plate) and Elaine Thomas (warm meditation deep within the mountain of cold humanity).Drawings by Blessing. Check it out. Magazine editors want mail. Allow this mention to be an invitation. I hope he don't mind.<p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After twenty years in the poe-biz and after producing 20 issues (that means
one a year and a lot of the time and money out of the pocket folks)
Slipstream should now be canonized as a Saint of poetry magazines.
Slipstream has been around longer than most marriages, your children, your
car, the place you now live in, the wine you were saving, the life span of
whales and gazelles, four presidents, 43 countries in the world, the OJ
trial, John Denver,  -- but not as long as Ronald Raygun - or Nancy - but
that is OK. If you don't know about them as yet - Hello. Aloha. Knock-Knock.
Slipstream has, does, is the foremost promoter of the poetry of the
scandalous, dark, forgotten and/or secret lives of people. Slipstream
features poetry by the skeleton in the soul's closet. You will enjoy it.
Each issue features not just a list of names you recognize but poems by
poets you don't, and they are good poems. The Slipstreamers take care to
edit. They are editors. And this one, this issue is truly an anthology of
our nation's intrepid poets who are frank enough to engage fully and
artfully in our forbidden lusts and the tempting facets and feces of each
and every day of life. Send money - only six clams! - for a fine ish! Learn.
Send poems. Who knows? Maybe you are Zeus or Venus?

Press, Inc., 181 Edgemont Avenue, Elmwood, CT. 06110-1005. $10.00.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Releasing poetry from the burden of the pious personal seriousness and
giving words back to makers and creators of poems, Sheila E. Murphy's three
part poems roller coaster roasters about from the highest of eight story
buildings straight down in free fall fireball FreeCell feral drop through
the ground as if it did not exist and into the hot bowels of mother earth.
The poems are full of the twisties and turners that only warping, twisting,
modeling and shaping syntax can create. Truly these poems are a dissonant
poetry. And it forces you to read another way other than in time, in
narrative, in a straight line. In this dream, meaning imaginative state,
like rising from the wine-dark sea are these pearl roses, "Whose wit along
horizons shapes the sentences as they were always scapular." -or- "Try to
vague you out of what you do not know." These are the gem germs that can
only come forward and appear after the practice of really breaking all the
rules governing the art of poetry are broken. Sheila Murphy takes the lion
of poetry and with whip and chair boots it around so that the poem appears
to arrive with all the intensity and beastliness of an otherworld
(otherWORD) creature that can only be labeled imaginative beauty.

Cold Comfort: Selected Poems 1970-1996</a></u></b><br> by Lyn Lifshin. 1997. 278 pages. <a href="http://www.blacksparrowpress.com">Black Sparrow Press,</a> 24 Tenth Street, Santa Rosa, California, 95401.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is really no denialing the awesome presence of Lyn Lifshin's poetry in
the American lit. landscape. More than any other poet I can haul to mind,
Lifshin, alone, has the ability to speak with a genuine American voice to
all of us peeps, people and dogs. I'll write that in the age of the WWW
Lifshin will take her place (a blue palace - which is the Eros of words -
she is the blue witch of the Eros as words - I am convinced) as rightful
master - akin to lofties like Robert Frost and Carl Sandbag. She has the
ability to be of our moment and is our monument.  Easy, yes, to read a few
poems in a magazine - here and there - and in little books, but poets like
Lyn Lifshin, because she produces tiny, fast slivers of wood in your
heart-mind and sliver like fish poems that escape like water thought your
fingers, because of this a big book in hand is so much an important event
and can only that way grant a fair reading. What happens is that Cold
Comfort plants the mind right in the middle of an imaginative cosmos that is
recognizable as the real world and one that is not. In other words, and
other words are what poets really work with, in other words Lyn Lifshin has
created a realm of American poetry so original as to stand alone and aloft.
Get the big book.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doug Holder. Imagine that poet, with notebook or scrap of paper capturing
instantaneous instances like rare insects in the midst of a yacking
socializing crowd in Harvard Square, Cambridge, writing a book of poems and
you have (if your write to him) in hand Dreams at the Au Bon Pain. It is
poetry netting crisp snapshots of memory between sips of strong coffee and
sweet deserts and spontaneous perch watching as humanity and his drifts in
and out of a crowd in and around an outside sidewalk coffee cafe. His dreams
are tender and widening, reverberating circles on dark pools of felt but
undefined deep emotion. All a poet, he runs <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rconte/home.html"><u>Ibbetson Street Press</a></u>, and edits
Ibbetson Street Magazine. Write him. Send work. He is among the vertebra
that holds the Boston and eastern Mass. poetry community up to snuff.<p>
