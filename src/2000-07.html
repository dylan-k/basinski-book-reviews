&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FUCK! is a poetry magazine from Tucson. Tucson, I seem to recall, was a very
lucky place for me. I found two twenties and five on the street! All in one
place. It pays to look down. Now about this good FUCK! This is a slim
photocopy job. But Thorn is a thorn in dull poetry.  Ask Jay Miner because
he has been in FUCK! Who else? This particularly issue: Thorn, Normal,
Harland Ristau, Carl Miller Dennis and more. Yes, we all like our names. So,
if you are the kinda writer and poet that likes her poetry as a rusty nail
being driven into a cat's paw with a jack-hammer or finding vodka salami in
his brown lunch bag sandwich or listening to lard windows with condom
victrolas or - well you get it, I hope. FUCK is for YOU. Send money, stamps,
paper, dog licenses, etc. to L. Thorn. Do it before Saturday night.</font><p>

<a name="2"></a>&#149; <b><u>Eve </b>by J. N. Foster.</u> About 30 pages. $12.00.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought at first the book was Eye but it is EVE and J. N. is Jeff  N. Foster, poet. There are twenty-five Eve poems, as in Adam and Eve, in this
book. So first I thought, well how good could a fist full of Eve be? I
didn't know. I ate two apples and opened the book. "Shaved genitals of milk
weed husk/ Performed a clitorectomy on a plank stock gate." And then, "The
tonsured macabre's/ Syrupy benediction/ Mauling olfactory with sex." Well, I
said, leaving the Garden of Eden, not bad, not bad, indeed. And a little of
religious symbols, crashes and asses and the like on Foster's photographs on
the cover. Also soft but sensual and hot but then there is the cross of
Christ. Interesting or don't touch. It is a hard space to mix the erotic
with the religious. Both can get ruined real fast or get purposely preachy
or too liberated and then porny. Foster seems to walk the line and mix a bit
of both to get nice chemical cocktail. He lets the words themselves be
erotic in their lace and leather lines. So this makes it art and not broken
glass. Seduction by a drink full of vowels and juxtapositioning of weighty
words. This poet knows the power of a word. He has found out. I think it got
him tossed out of Eden. He bit. I bet.<p> &nbsp;

<a name="3"></a>&#149; <b><u>Marijuana Soft Drink </b> by Buck Downs.</u><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2000. 71 pages. $11.00.  Edge Books,
P.O. Box 25642, Washington, DC 20007.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mailto:aerialedge@aol.com">aerialedge@aol.com</a><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck Downs so musical a name, I always thought, now he has this book too:
Marijuana Soft Drink. What thoughts might I have then this Sunday night,
thinking of this title, here in Buffalo it is June and wet. Drink down
seduction musical Buck Downs's music is word music that can't be located
everyday. Dance of letters and slitting words in half, opoeming a fruit that
pulls you along. It is music like Kerouac's Mexico City Blues and like that
the poems are one pagers that rambling around tight rift and waves of words
weaved that you have too have too drink of off the shore, that call you
back, oh come back you missed something and you know it… to read again and
again each again something new in the form foam on the beach. Loomed I had
to read the entire thing twice because of the seduction, Siren calling poems
so fruit fine to be seduced, seaducted transported by: "man is memory's/
plaything supremely/ colliding & shit// a dim bucket of vector/ making
dangerous soup/ from dangerous soup mix"  Go Buck!

<a name="4"></a>&#149; <b><u>Immersion Tones</b> by Sheila E. Murphy.</u>- 2000. Luna Bisonte Prods, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;137 Leland
Avenue. Columbus, Ohio 43124.  $10.00. 36 pages.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book divided into 33 poems/ 3 sections, Christly, or a month a little
longer than a calendars. Sheila E. Murphy a craft poet and prolific at that
and if you are wondering how to be that first this book can instruct by
opening THE Great Biblical proportion flood gate from Murphy's immense
imagination pouring Niagara Falls into/of/and all about poetry. Each line is
alone which you don't find in poetry these days. That is only the beginning
of the craft. One rises and falls with her lines and breathe as the lines
play back against themselves and within her rhythm you fall into the next
line and on until what happens, I think, you become one imagination  -no
not-bothered by I disagree this or like that but swept along on perfume rich
luscious word on top of or under upon word whip cream and strawberry. You
can't go wrong: from the 7th poem called The Seventh, "The gills are all I
will for./ All the blades across small seas./ The hems of lineage entreat
their way across unwanted sanctity./ No matter stalks the winsome creed/
without a lever to emboss the crissed long-suffering bold weeds/ that I
could do without,/ that my crawled blade could swish apart form common
greed."<br><br>&nbsp;

The Back East Poems</b> by Gerald Locklin.</u> 2000. Liquid Paper Press, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;PO. Box 4973 Austin, Texas, 78765. 64 pages $5.00.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Locklin writes effortless, easy flowing, flawlessly engineered
poems. Without the pretence, cerebral arrogance or aggressive verbal
acrobatics of those cloistered in University towers or those rich kids sun-
bathing after lunch in the south of France. The poems of Gerald Locklin
debunk the notion that poetry is the private club of eggheads. Poetry in the
life of Locklin is everyday and the everyday.  The poems are about the
wandering of the mind, its tangled web and the inevitable twists of fate
that governs life. These Back East poems track the traveling poet Locklin
traveling from reading to reading, Niagara Falls, Chicago, Pittsburgh,
Akron, and visiting his children, and children and the last living of his
aunts in Rochester, New York, and are about the dogs he meets (four
different dogs in the pages of this collection).  Traveling back east from
California (to where Locklin was born) gives place and reason for the
writing of these poems. However, The Back East Poem are really not totally
just all about these locations or the poet people he encounters.  The poems
succinctly define the place of poetry in Locklin's own life, which guides
each of us, each reader, to the poetic recess of our own imagination. Each
of us, each day encounter poetry. As the mind wonders/wanders in the
everyday fate and the ironic notion of mind - misdirection - like hating a
painting in his house and later realizing is was Renoir or taking the wrong
medicine the little items of everyday life - the quirky turns in the river
are the stuff of Locklin's poetry.  Generous - and filled with love of
family and friends. And he is happy for life and the storms and oddities and
tricks and seeks the quite time.  Locklin is king of chapbooks for sure and
this one is one of his traveling narrative/journals in poetry. Here all the
ironic tricks, the private, the yearning for more days of writing all appear
here in front of him: fate/time/friends/children/ah - the things of poetry.<p>
