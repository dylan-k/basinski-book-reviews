Once every now and then one comes upon something that is simply beautiful
and this book is such art. It is here, endless peace and the coming and
going of water foul, swans, geese, and egrets. The poems complement and
mesh like bird and water with the paintings. They are one thing, one art.
Rarely do facets so vastly different merge so well, so perfectly. It is
then nature the great thing we live in that allows this symbiosis to
manifest. The rhythms of the poems, biological rhythms, are with those of
the paintings. It is as if one enters a hall given over to meditation, it
is as if one is once again primal and refreshed. Here, rejoice in this
book. It is wonderful to know that in this often too horrible world that
there is peace, peace that one can locate in the natural of this art and in
the nature that it mirrors.

I read, on page 49, Nothing will be disclosed/ but stone to dissolve/ at
the border…. And it was then at that point that I had to return to poem one
and begin reading again to be within the poetry which was my car, I within
it, parked by a lake and geese overhead. And with my next breath moist on
the window, it is now cold in Buffalo, I was released again, as I am by
great poetry to travel within my life.  To knock away the dirty dishes and
the rising gas prices and the upcoming Bush war, such pleasure to dissolve
the stone.  And it was only two in the afternoon and I had pleasantly the
rest of the half day and full night the do without borders and the meaning
of the gas bill and again be, as I was when I was a boy, and first that
poetry, poems like these, allowed people like me, and you, access, free and
open, to other real realms.<p>

<a name="3"></a><u><b>Essays</u></b> - by Luc Fierens...<br>...with introduction by Tom Hibbard. Structum Press. 2002. Tom Hibbard, 31390 Hill Road, Hartland, WI 53029. $5.00.

Luc Fierens lives in Belgium where he is centrally networked with the vast
web of European mail-artists, (which extends into the USA), contemporary
Flux artists, neo-dadaists, performance and sound poets and visual poets
working in the area of collage writing. Like us here, in the vast dumbness
of an America that allows George W. Bush to hold the title President, Luc
Fierens is brilliant, creative and unknown. So, here is your chance, you
meta-poets, visualists, mail-artists, and contrary thinkers and creators,
to be most pleasantly influenced by a host of insight comments into the
creative passion and person of Luc Fierens. In this small text I think is
reveled the true nature of the artist, which is in each moment creatively
rules. And for the visual artist the collage is an endless collage and all
everything becomes the material of the grand collage of living and each day
adds to it and essays are just another form in which to exercise collage,
visual writing. Here are collages and juxtaposed diary entries and critical
comment and an introduction by Tom Hibbard to place it all in a context. A
joy. Hey, you avant-gourd! (yes it is supposed to be that spelling - be
creative) Are any of you out there? Check this out! Contact Hibbard. And
then contact Fierens: <a href="mailto:Luc.Fierens@overtoom.be?subject=basinski_reviews_thehold">Luc.Fierens@overtoom.be</a>

A pleasant surprise to find these poems in this book in the mail. And when
I read the poem Snail, in which the poet's father cooks a snail to brew a
snail broth, I knew, yes, the broth of memory brewed with poetry was in the
cup of my hand. The steam of these, the perfume, the poet is in the world.

Poems of sparrows and rainy urban streets with scraps of paper stuck to the
pavement of the imagination, so Kryss moves about in poetry as a alchemist,
"…with a knowledge that guides… the artisans transform common materials/
into small objects of wonder."  He reaches out in these tight lines, with
these crafted lines like a baseball player from one of his poems, to catch,
to reach for IT! IT the space between the real that is then the poem and
the poetry comes up through the fissures in humanity from everywhere and we
are all angels and sparrows. The IT of poetry is everywhere in the poems of
Tom Kryss. He finds IT in the face of Jane Goodall, in an old black man in
a wheelchair, in midgets, in a children's librarian. What I like in the
poems of T. Kryss is that they opened in me the notion that poetry does not
just belong to small circle of masturbating precious poodles but is in fact
all places at all times and one needs only to engage IT. There IT is. Here
IT is. Here is a book of poems by Tom Kryss, a ring of keys.
