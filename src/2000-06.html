<a name="1"></a>&#149; <u>40th Century Man</u> - Selected Verse: 1996-1966 (no misprint) by Andy Clausen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Autonomedia, Williamsburgh Station, Brooklyn, New York, 11211-0568
190pp.$8.00.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poet Andy Clausen finds his tradition in the wandering, exploring, growing
American poets, like Kerouac. And Clausen's poetry has also a social
consciousness. He knows that injustice hurts those most who cannot afford to
purchase justice, the too silent American working class. Giving his life in
pursuit of a poetry that records his maturation, insights, errors, ups and
downs, turns, curves and backslides, Clausen, the son of immigrants, finds
himself a perpetual outsider.  He is the 40th century man, the alien in
America, the Lone Ranger Poet in front of the runaway American LOCOmotive.
He has chosen (or by fate was destined) to be an outsider. I mention this
because Clausen's poetry is not the poetry of a rich brat experiencing
(slumming) life for a few years only to return the wide green, chemically
treated, upper class, suburban lawn life.  From the outside of  inner center
privilege, Clausen is quite uniquely suited to chronicle the last thirty
years. His poetry depends on an honest insight and an honest commitment. It
is an honesty that he cannot and can never walk away from or dodge. He is
honest. His life, via the poems, attests to this. His poetic realism is,
therefore, in many ways uncomfortable. It is risky. In fact, poet and poetry
risk everything for insight and clarity. Clausen pledged to be true to his
own self. He pledges to record the world he encounters. He has and is. The
poems are ordered from the most recently written (the continuous frank
present) and march backward through time. He begins by insight, explores,
and throughout his history, Clausen is looking and finding. Still, he is
seeking. On the path, the road, on the journey thought life, Clausen proves,
again and again, that poetry is essential.<p>&nbsp;<p>

<a name="2"></a>&#149; <u>Down and Out by Gerald Locklin</u>, with illustrations by David Hernandez.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Event
Horizon Press, PO Box 2006, Palm Springs, Ca. 92263. 350 pp. $34.95.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Locklin writes narrative, semi-autobiographical poems of
significant, practical, American insight and philosophy. As a poet, he's
published more than 60 books.  However, of late, he's branched into the
realm of fiction.  Now, he has published a big book, a novel, which he has
titled Down and Out. The novel is fictional reportage.  Locklin's fictional
persona is Jimmy Abbey, English Professor, womanizer, and down and out, out
and out, drunk.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Composed of 69 chapters of various lengths, Locklin's Down and Out is
cleanly written, and his unadorned prose is consistently entertaining. With
only the slightest detail to arrange and order the world in which Abbey
thrives, Locklin's realism is overwhelmingly convincing. While not being
totally autobiographical, it certainly would seem that Locklin had more than
some first hand knowledge of the drinking life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set in the 1970s, Down and Out details the escapades of Jimmy Abbey on
his own turf, Sand Beach, perhaps a loosely disguised Long Beach,
California. Locklin has been Professor of English for more than three
decades in Long Beach, California. And also part of the novel is set during
a summer in London. The gregarious Abbey is a serious drinker and womanizer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he is often successful as a womanizer, the womanizing seems to take
second place to his hard drinking. Womanizing is simply a by-product of his
thirst. And Abbey is one thirsty boy. Yet, when Abbey participates in the
drinking sub-culture, he is neither bum nor pitiful slob. He is a drunk from
the professional, professorial class. For this reason, Abbey is a unique
creation. The professorial ranks harbor a good many drunks. Not often are
they exposed in prose or in life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a committed boozer, Abbey is able to function at his job and
maintains a more or less stable domestic situation. He drinks, seemingly,
for the pure, hedonistic pleasure and enjoyment of the sauce. He is not
particularly pathological. He is not particularly macho. He mixes his vodka
with Tang.  Tangled in the boozing sub-culture, Locklin's Abbey is an
American outsider, but he is neither a derelict or an antisocial figure like
Bukowski's Hank Chinaski nor a bravado bulging Hemingway male. Both of these
authors, obviously, are models for Locklin's prose. Abbey is neither a
cynical figure nor a character ruled by dark and deep traumas. Abbey is a
common alcoholic, an alcoholic Everyman. He is only slightly addicted, as
are most Americans slightly addicted to something. In fact, Abbey seems more
ordinary than ordinary. It is his everyday raunchy and secretive, sleaziness
that makes him so believable an American character. He touches each of our
own personal perversities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Jimmy Abbey is at various points down, he is never really counted
out. He regains his footing and, albeit stumbling and staggering, carries
on.  He touches bottom and optimistically bounces back to land on his feet.
In one sense, Abbey gets his cake and drinks it too. Down and Out is
subtitled a novel for adults, although, seemingly, not because of its
content. Perhaps this subtitle is part of the novel's sarcasm.  Hardly
horrible or hard core, the novel portrays a naughty American adult. As any
good populace fiction, movie, or TV program in our times, Down and Out
concludes positively with these two words: happy ending.

<a name="3"></a>&#149; <u>CokeFish Ing in Alpha Beat Soup</u>: A Beat-Post Independent Poetry Broadsheet.<br>
 May 2000. Published monthly. $10.00 a year. Buck a single copy. Contact:<br>
Alpha Beat Press: Ana and Dave Christy, 31B Waterloo Street, New Hope, PA 18938.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this monthly broadside is dedicated to the small press and the way it
used to be. That used to be what still is here: is IS the free and open
expression of poetry as spiritual high from the individual soul crying,
screaming, gut twisting, hula-hoop, poetry that knows no boundary of art,
meaning, the isms and great walls of poetry that surrounds all us in the
poetry, the camps and cramps the living poetry out of us. See. So Dave and
Ana wanna poetry that is an all poetry. And committed they have not been
co-opted or corrupted. I wish I were so clean. I wish. I wish. This iss/you
has Antler, Joy Walsh, Belinda Subraman, Neeli Cherkovski, and more and
more. I mean this is a one page thing. For Christ's sake, send them some
bucks and maybe some poems and books.<p>&nbsp;<p>

<a name="4"></a>&#149; <u>Driver's Side Airbag No. 39</u>. P.O. Box 25760, Los Angeles, California 90025.<br>
Subscription is $10.00 a year for which you get 4 issues. See also web:<br>
<a href="www.dsazine.com">www.dsazine.com</a> and <a href="mailto:info@dsazine.com">email: info@dsazine.com</a><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Driver's Side Airbag is one of those places where along the poetry
path of life one stops for a beer, a smoke, a piece of greasy chicken,
noodle salad, candy bar, urinate, and to check the map. Now the map is 60
pages fat with all you need to think about. It should be read so read:
addresses and poems, and collages and advertisements from friends of the
outsider family, and prose and prose and cartoons. A real bowkay! OK? OK! So
who do you get: Robert W. Howlington, Blair Wilson, Thaddeus Rutkowski, Mike Diana, Malok. Just think of these artists out there in Wisconsin and Oregon and Dallas and New York and Florida. Wouldn't you rather be there, than watching the final season episode of Malcolm in the Middle?   Well you can, if you weren't so lazy and cheap. If you have gotten this far make the leap
of faith. Atta girl. Atta boy.<p>
