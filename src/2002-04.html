&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zenyth is a one page literary magazine that features poems - obviously -
short poems on both sides of the single sheet. These issues in hand feature
poems by Bart Solarczyk and <a href="androla.html">Ron Androla</a> and Wendy A. Howe and the editor
Danielle Taschereau. And of course there are others. Folded up Zenyth fits
good in your pocket, which is where good poems should be for the bus ride
home or to be read while eating the evening can of green beans or spaghetti
and then a can of beer. Poems between commercials, that is what I like and
that is what Zenyth offers. No, that is what Zenyth gives you. Zenyth
gives. Give me a page of poems. Thanks for pages of poems. These  single
pages, these poems hold back the flood of mundane words and keep boredom
out walking the dog.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember sitting in a bar and looking out the window and seeing a spotted black and white three-legged dog getting porked by a four-legged brown dog. The three-legged dog had one of her front legs missing. I guess it doesn't matter what three legs a dog has if you are on the bottom. But what if a three-legged guy dog was the top dog and that dog had one only leg in the back? Well, then what? Would it matter or if you were in the bar looking out the window would you just open issue number one of Bosh Hubris? Well?
Eventually you would open the magazine and in it you finds this great prose
by master twister of the word Jack Balls! His prose in this issue is I SHOT
HELEN VENDLER, which in and of itself - meaning the title - is enough to
place Bosh Hubris up there on the alter. And then there is Don Winter's
Strip Bar: Hamtamck. Having been in many, many bars in Hamtamck, well they
were all poetry and so is this bar and poem. And let's mention the last
poem in the issue, Alan Catlin's The Workingman's Friend. A clear
observation about ugly men in bars, which is something that Catlin should
know about cause he works as a bartender. Maybe he is bartending in the bar
in which I am reading this mag. I wonder if Catlin knows that outside a
three-legged dog is being porked? I don't know. I just keep reading the
prose of Lyn Lifshin, the prose of Wanda Coleman, a poem by Hugh Fox. The
list goes on and outside the four-legged dog just wont quit.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the elephants break down the walls! Let the great Moby Dick smash the
hull of the dull Pequad. Allow the zebras and the people waiting for the
bus in the cold of February to eat hot fish frys served by old nuns. Allow
the cans at the curb be filled with the money of the rich. Allow the car to
always start and the dents to pop out as if the car were foam and let the
foam on the top of your beer be thick and free. Let there be Bender number
four, NO. 4! Numero FourO! Ah. Up through the dullness, well, let's start
off by noting that the guts and heart and soul center section of this issue
are a section by Ron Koertge's called On the Horn- READ his poem In the
Dirty Book Store. Ah, the strange joys of dirty book stores. Ah, my lost
youth. And let me quote Jeff Karl Butler's Beer Song:<br>
<br>
<i>pale<br>
ale<br>
sale</i><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a great poem by Joan Jobe Smith, which from up on the go-go stage her
insight into the rotting souls of young pinheaded guys in the bar slices in
to what is essentially wrong with America. And another great one by Lyn
Lifshen who cuts into the pale blue soul of AM with a morning without
coffee blade.  And it goes on with Gerald Locklin and Nathan Graziano and
Robert L. Pernick and Mark Wisniewski. These are new forms of gods here.
These gods refuse to die. Let the poetry of Bender magazine take the place
of the spongy, diseased brain of Attorney General John Asscraft. Let the
grass grow dewy on the palm of Christ. Let Bender magazine and Jeff Epley
be the cure for lung cancer so we can all smoke until eternity. Let Bender
magazine and Bender's editor Jeff Epley make money for this labor of love
and the love that will drain all organs of sex and let them fill up fast
again for another draining. Let Bender magazine and editor Jeff Epley ride
dinosaurs to Australia and to India and on the graves of the great poets in
a form of Stegosaurus homage, homage of powerful dinosaurs is Bender and
Epley listening to Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Fearing and Kenneth Patchen
and Charles Bukowski.  Epley, out there, keep riding. Man, Christ, Jesus,
he has made one fucking beautiful magazine.

<a name="4"></a><b><u>The Life of All Worlds</u></b> - by Marc Widershien. <br>62pp. $10.00. Ibbetson Street Press in conjunction with Stone Soup Poets, Somerville, MA. <a href="mailto:ibbetsonstreet@go.com">ibbetsonstreet@go.com</a><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once within the poetry of Marc Widershien's The Life of All Worlds, one is drawn, floats into the self and into the own-self's geography of memory and the cities of that place within that memory and in the heart. This poem in 21 parts is a key and once in the door of the self, the poetry of that terrain rises to be alive. I found my own portal within these lines:<br>
<br>
<i>A tuna fish sandwich exploded<br>
as I squeezed it into the wax paper</i><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, how I love wax paper. Widershien's poems are a lunch bag full of such
particulars and treats and the streets of growing up and that past that is
the present and allows to continue growth. I am happy that such poetry
exists and that poets like Marc Widershien's allow such particulars to be
part of our life. Hail to his imagination for his imagination allows us to
enter ours. Poetry can do such things, make such magic.
